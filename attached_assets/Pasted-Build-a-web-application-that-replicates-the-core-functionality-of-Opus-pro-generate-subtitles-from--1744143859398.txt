Build a web application that replicates the core functionality of Opus.pro: generate subtitles from videos through automatic speech recognition, preview them, and burn them into the video (hardcoded). The app should be entirely local and must not require an API key to run.

üéØ Core Requirements:
Video Upload

Accept video files from users (.mp4, .mov, .webm)

Validate file type and size

Audio Extraction

Extract audio from the uploaded video using ffmpeg

Save audio as .wav or .mp3 for processing

Transcription (Whisper)

Use the open-source Whisper model from https://github.com/openai/whisper

Install via pip install -U openai-whisper

Do not use OpenAI's transcription API ‚Äî no API key should be required

Perform transcription locally using tiny, base, small, or medium models

Language: auto-detect or allow user to specify

Output: .srt and/or .vtt with timestamps

Subtitle Generation

Format the transcription into proper .srt or .vtt

Split long sentences if necessary for readability

Ensure timestamps are correctly aligned

Hardcode Subtitles into Video

Automatically burn subtitles into the original video using ffmpeg

Do not offer timing options ‚Äî use the timestamps from the .srt file as-is

Output: .mp4 video with hardcoded subtitles (output_with_subs.mp4)

Example command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='FontName=Arial,FontSize=24'" -c:a copy output_with_subs.mp4
Preview Feature

Include a view to preview the video with subtitles (HTML5 <video> + <track>)

Optional step before final render

üß± Recommended Stack:
Frontend:

Next.js + TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

HTML5 Video player

Backend:

Node.js (Express or Fastify) or Python (Flask/FastAPI)

ffmpeg for media processing

Local whisper CLI via Python subprocess

multer (Node) or upload handlers to receive video files

‚ùóÔ∏èAdditional Notes:
All processing (transcription + ffmpeg) should run locally

Must work entirely offline (except for downloading the Whisper model initially)

No API key, no paid services

Ensure code is modular: upload/, transcribe/, subtitles/, render/
