I need you to develop a complete application that:

Accepts video uploads from users
Extracts audio from these videos
Accurately converts this audio to text using the OpenAI Whisper API or similar technology
Creates synchronized captions for the original video
Allows users to download the video with embedded captions

Specific Technical Requirements:

Video Input: Accept common formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.) and allow uploads or URL specification
Audio Extraction: Use FFmpeg to extract audio in suitable format
Transcription:

Implement OpenAI's Whisper API for transcription (or open-source alternative like Whisper.cpp)
Automatically detect language or allow manual selection
Maintain accurate timestamps for synchronization


Caption Generation: Create SRT or VTT files with correct timestamps
Video Embedding: Render captions on the video while maintaining original quality
Interface: Develop intuitive frontend showing real-time progress
Performance: Optimize for processing speed and accuracy

Desired Advanced Features:

Automatic translation of captions to other languages
Manual editing of transcribed text before final rendering
Customization of caption style (font, size, color, position)
Detection and differentiation of multiple speakers
Noise filtering to improve accuracy in low-quality audio
Support for videos with complex cuts or transitions
API for integration with other tools

Technical Implementation:
Please provide:

Detailed system architecture
Data flow between components
Technology and library choices with justifications
Infrastructure requirements
Pseudocode or actual code for critical components
Step-by-step implementation instructions
Scalability and performance considerations

Include solutions for common challenges such as:

Processing long videos
Handling accents or low-quality audio
Precise synchronization between audio and text
Computational resource management

Expected Result:
A complete, robust, and highly accurate solution that works in various scenarios and produces professional-quality captions with minimal human intervention.
